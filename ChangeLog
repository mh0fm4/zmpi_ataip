  * New release version 1.0.4 (first release on github.com/mh0fm4/zmpi_ataip)
  * Fix wrong name in license headers
  * Add ZMPI_Alltoall_inplace_symmetric and ZMPI_Neighbor_alltoall_inplace_symmetric, i.e, in-place versions of regular all-to-all based on the symmetric algorithms (linear and hierarchic plus randomized versions, algorithm selection is controled by global variable ZMPI_Alltoall_inplace_symmetric_sym_type)
  * Clean up global variables and constants
  * Fix ZMPI_Neighbor_alltoallv_inplace_symmetric
  * Minor fixes


2013-06-01

  * New release version 1.0.3
  * Add ZMPI_Neighbor_alltoallv_inplace and ZMPI_Neighbor_alltoallv_inplace_symmetric conforming to the neighborhood collectives of MPI version 3.0 (all neighborhood versions are controled by the same global variables as the original (dense) versions)
  * Rework symmetric algorithms and add randomized versions (algorithm selection is controled by global variables ZMPI_Alltoallv_inplace_sym_type and ZMPI_Alltoallv_inplace_symmetric_type)
  * Support usage of auxiliary memory for ZMPI_Alltoallv_inplace_symmetric (and ZMPI_Neighbor_alltoallv_inplace_symmetric)
  * Use radix sort (1-bit msdf) instead of qsort
  * Misc. cleanup


2013-04-12

  * New release version 1.0.2
  * Add ZMPI_Alltoallv_inplace_symmetric that supports the standardized symmetric in-place exchange of MPI_Alltoallv only
  * Add new symmetric algorithms (linear and hierarchic)
  * Fix memory leaks in the auxiliary heap version and the local generic heap


Initial release version 1.0.1
